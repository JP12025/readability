Sophie couldn't sleep. 

A brilliant moonbeam was slanting through a gap in the curtains.
It was shining right on to her pillow.

The other children in the dormitory had been asleep for hours.

Sophie closed her eyes and lay quite still.
She tried every hard to doze off.

It was no good. 
The moonbeam was like a silver blade slicing through the room on to her face.
